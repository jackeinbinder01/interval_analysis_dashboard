# interval_analysis_dashboard
The Interval Analysis Dashboard leverages the MusicNet Dataset, a curated sample of labeled classical music, to measure the ratio of musical intervals against the key center of a piece in a filtered sample of aggregated data

The purpose of this analysis is to measure the ratio of specific musical intervals to all notes in a filterable sample of note level data
This analysis is intended for musicians and composers who wish to draw quick insights, from an aggregated sample of classical pieces, based on the ratio of intervals in a sample of pieces
